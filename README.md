# aws-project-1-quickloan

🚀 Excited to share my latest project: QuickLoan – a fully functional loan application deployed on AWS!

I recently designed and deployed a secure, scalable web application for loan applications using Amazon Linux 2023, Nginx, PHP, and MySQL. Here’s a quick overview of what I built:

🌐 Application Features

Loan application form with Name, Contact, Email, Loan Type

Form data stored in a MySQL database

PHP backend with prepared statements for secure data handling

Responsive UI with HTML/CSS

☁️ AWS Deployment Architecture

VPC with 3 public subnets across multiple AZs

Internet Gateway and custom route table for public access

EC2 instance running Nginx + PHP, automatically assigned public IP

Security Group allowing SSH & HTTP traffic

Optional SSM-managed Amazon Linux 2023 AMI for seamless updates

Automated database integration with secure credentials

⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools

Frontend: HTML, CSS

Backend: PHP, MySQL (MariaDB)

Cloud: EC2, VPC, Security Groups, Route Tables

OS: Amazon Linux 2023

🔐 Key Highlights

Secure data handling with prepared statements

Scalable cloud infrastructure

Fully automated provisioning using CloudFormation templates

Ready for production with proper VPC design and subnet architecture

💡 This project was a great opportunity to combine web development skills with cloud infrastructure knowledge, and it gave me hands-on experience deploying real-world applications on AWS.
